# MyLauncher

M*c*Launcher, but mine

a (hopefully) lightweight, free and open source [Minecraft](minecraft.net)-launcher

## About

The default Minecraft launcher by [Mojang](mojang.com) (the company that develops Minecraft) usually
takes a long time to load. This started to annoy me, so I started thinking about using a 3rd-party
launcher. But since I couldn't find a (on Linux working) open source one, I decided to develop my own
one.

This would also give me the freedom to add features, like server support, so here we are.
